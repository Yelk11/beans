How to make the game more fun, challenging, and dynamic.
    - What micro decision are being made and how can we affect them? Generally limiting to only one solution is best
        - All the generators dont have to gen linearly, some can be more productive that others
        - What if each generator had a different function? exponential, polynomial, log?
        - 
    - Tap into management theory?
        - build up confidence of bean workers
        - pay bean workers (more pay, more effective)
        - culture
        - focus? (over time employees lose focus and you must refocus them)
        - workers/employees
            what do they do?
            - Start different generators
            - can handle a specific number of generators
            - courage affects how effective employee is
            - 
        - types of buildings?
            facory:
                generators are housed here
                low income workers
            office:
                marketing department is here
                managers?
                finance department
                    - bean stockmarket (hehe beanstock)
                purchasing dept
                    - buy dirt, water, fertilizer for bean growth
                    - buy types of beans?
                    - cost of power consumption
                
Achievements 
- Income levels
- get 100% happiness in workers
- get .01% happiness in workers

Type of generation
- main generators
- prestige
- stock market buying/ selling



# Design

## Employees



## Bean Factory
Equation: F(x) = F+1(x) * x
- Generator after times current amount of generator
- Creates polynomial growth when next generator gens this generator
- uses water
- uses dirt

## Finance Dept
- stock market (buy/sell) equation: maybe sin(x)?
- Display income stats
    - Net income
    - Profits
    - Expenses
    - Taxes?


## Purchasing Dept
- buy water: growing consumes water
- buy powerplant: factories consume power
- buy dirt: enough dirt gets a new factory
